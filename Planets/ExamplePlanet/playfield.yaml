      # InitialDelay: 1         # Float [0, 10000] Initial delay in game hours before spawning of asteroids, if InitialDelay < 0 => no spawning
      # Delay: 24               # Float [0, 10000] Subsequent delay in game hours, if Delay = 0 => no spawning
      # DespawnDelay: 5         # Float [0, 10000] Delay in game hours after which asteroid will be removed. If parameter is not set or set to 0, asteroid will not despawn

### POIs
# The POI spawning algorithm goes from top to down, so place important POIs on top to make sure they are placed. Moreover, the timing is as follows: 1. Drone base spawning, 2. POI spawning, 3. Resource deposit spawning
