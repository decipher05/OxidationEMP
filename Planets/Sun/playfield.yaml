### Randomly distributed resources  # For Seed>0 games     # Please don't change
# RandomResources:

### POIs      # Please don't change
# Parameters:
# 1: Prefab group name
# 2: min,max = range of number of POIs of this group to distribute on planet
# 3: min,max,reserveCount,prob
#    min,max = range of number of Drones that defend POI
#    reserveCount = number of Drones that will replace killed Drone
#    prob = probability that a certain POI is defended by Drones, if 4 digits -> TroopTransport

# Parameters:
# 1: Prefab group name
# 2: min,max,reserveCount,prob
#    min,max = range of number of Drones that defend POI
#    reserveCount = number of Drones that will replace killed Drone
#    prob = probability that a certain POI is defended by Drones
# 3: LevelOfDifficulty, PresetStyle
#    LevelOfDifficulty : in the range [0, 4] -> 0 = no drone attack base, ..., 4 = Max difficulty level
