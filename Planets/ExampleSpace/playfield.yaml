# Playfield Characteristics
Gravity: 0                                    # Ignore (do not change)
AtmosphereEnabled: False                      # Ignore (do not change)
PlanetType: Space                             # Ignore (do not change)
PvP: False                                    # Bool var [true, false] - Set to True to allow PvP in this playfield, default is False
Radiation: 9.2                                # Float [0, 99] - currently game is balanced to support max radiation of 20 
TemperatureDay: -130                          # Integer [-270, 500]
Music: space                                  # Background music playing on this playfield - Choose from pre-selection: alien, alien2, barren, desert, desert2, lava, lava2, moonstone, snow, space, temperate, temperate2, temperate3. If nothing is selected default background music is playing
UseFixed: True                                # Ignore (do not change) - If set uses fixed drones. For space playfields, this is necessary      

# Playfield difficulty 
Difficulty: 2                                 # Integer [1, 5] Has impact on experience gains
