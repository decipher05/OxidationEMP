#Description: "[c][e0e020]Origin: %Origin%[-][/c]\n[c][d29818]Difficulty: Stupido Hard[-][/c]\nPluto is a Barren totally lifeless PvP planet, designed for those introverted people who just wanna be alone in the night, deserted base start, no water, no plants, no animals, not much lives long out here, no Ozone layer at all so theres high radiation levels really hard to make it here with zero plant life, a truely lonely start, you might NEED to use the market here so only go here if your OCD dedicated, maybe a place to be explored later dude! ok ok die if you must !. [c][e02020]Be warned, choosing this planet as the survival start is pretty much idiotic as it gets, crazy pie eating players only.Hardest Start Possible.[-][/c]"
